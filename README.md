Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Objective
We will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

# Details about the dataset
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Result 
Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, has the potential to revolutionize diabetes risk prediction and early identification. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes can significantly contribute to effective management and prevention of complications.The fundamental goal of this study was to prepare and imsplement Diabetes Prediction using various machine learning techniques, followed by an output analysis to identify the best classifier with the highest accuracy, that we have successfully achieved this goal. This work focuses on improving the accuracy of diabetes prediction by tuning the hyperparameters of the proposed model and evaluating different machine learning classification techniques.Among these techniques, KNN is more effective and produce better results than other ML classification techniques. The KNN algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 82.47%.
